## Topics

* **git** a version control software used to track and archive changes to files, very useful for managing research code and then sharing on servers. We had a [short class](https://github.com/ForEcolZappers/PublicWiki/tree/master/Git) on how the basics of git and how to use it to track and publish code for an individual and may have a future session on collaboration and advanced topics in git in the future.
